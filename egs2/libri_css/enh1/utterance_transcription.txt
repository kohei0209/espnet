overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session3_actual20.0_utterance_94	AND YET YOU MUST OWN HER BEHAVIOUR HAS WARRANTED THEM HAS IT NOT BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INCOHERENT AND UNACCOUNTABLE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session3_actual20.0_utterance_95	ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH

overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_0	WITHOUT HIS SCRAPBOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_1	WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_2	THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_3	THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_4	TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SILVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE

overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_8	HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_9	THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_10	WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_11	THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_12	TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT

overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_15	AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE

overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_18	BEN ZOOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVADAC'S EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMARTRE WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_19	NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MONTMARTRE

overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_21	IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_22	IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_23	SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_24	ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_25	IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBE CONTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_26	ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDITERRANEAN
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_27	THERE IS NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_28	PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_29	DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BEN ZOOF TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_30	I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_31	YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALGERIA AS YOU IMAGINED
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_32	THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_33	THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER EQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_34	THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BEN ZOOF'S ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_35	A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_36	IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_37	IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_38	WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_39	WELL SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY CHARENTE I ALSO THINK A GOOD DEAL BUT I TAKE CARE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_40	WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATER SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_41	THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_42	THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT OF THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_43	SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_44	IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAME'S AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTED CAVALIERS
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_45	BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_46	SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_47	WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_48	I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_49	THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_50	HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_51	WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_52	HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_53	WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_54	WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LOUIS
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_55	IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_56	BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_57	STUFF IT INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNSELLED HIM
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_58	MISTER SOAMES WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_59	MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_60	HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_61	THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUMER'S GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_62	A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATER BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_63	LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_64	IS IT BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_65	IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO AMASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST ACCRUING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_66	I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING

overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_69	IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_70	WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVADAC BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_71	THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_72	DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_73	MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_74	THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DIAS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATER OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
overlap_ratio_20.0_sil0.1_1.0_session4_actual20.0_utterance_75	A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
